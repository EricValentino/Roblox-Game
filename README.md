# My Roblox Game

Heart Grove is a Roblox Studio project that I programmed entirely in Lua. I built it to learn more about event-driven programming, modular scripting, and how different systems can work together inside a game. The entire experience is code-driven, from the gameplay mechanics to the interactive sequences and transitions.

## Technical Overview

The project is made up of multiple scripts that handle specific parts of the game. Each script was written from scratch and organized to keep the code modular and easy to maintain.

- **Teleportation System:** Uses event listeners and condition checks to move the player between areas and trigger effects.
- **NPC Dialogue:** Handles conversation through string tables, conditional responses, and simple timing loops for smooth text flow.
- **Collectible Logic:** Tracks heart items through arrays and uses loops to update progress in real time.
- **Camera and Cutscenes:** Uses tweening and timed sequences to create short in-game scenes and perspective shifts.
- **Player Scaling:** Implements custom functions to change player size and abilities dynamically based on in-game events.

## Development

Every feature was coded manually without external tools or pre-made systems. This allowed me to understand how Roblox handles events, player input, and communication between scripts. I focused on writing clean, reusable code and learned how to structure a project that combines visuals, logic, and interaction.

## Technologies Used

- Roblox Studio  
- Lua scripting  
- Roblox API (events, tween service, and user input service)

## Lessons Learned

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of game logic, debugging, and code organization. It also taught me how to balance functionality and creativity by building systems that are both efficient and fun to interact with.

## Future Plans

- Add new NPCs and dialogue branches  
- Introduce a save and load system  
- Expand environment interactions and ambient effects
